# devsLife

In case you have missed any announcements on the devslife discord channel, here's a quick recap so far:

The Devslife community will create different projects all under this repository titled Devslife. 

Once you get added as a collaborator, you will be able to contribute to any project on here. 

Of course, a lot of people are new, mistakes will be made and lessons will be learned. 

But that is the exact point! its a learning experience. Through getting involved on this repository and the devslife discord community we can learn, build and improve on things together.

And what better way than to contribute to the open source community and get your github profile activity looking healthy.

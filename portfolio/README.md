## To do

1. We need a fixed menu at the top, with a logo space on the left and about, contact links on the right.  
2. Below the menu, is the main banner of the page, it should be animated on load, using a library like three.js, where it interacts with a visitor's mouse cursor.
3. Below the main banner, there should be a table with a list of skills and a respective bar showing a percentage of how good you are i.e. css 99%.
4. We need a footer at the bottom, the footer should just include the credits to the devslife community and the MIT clause.
5. The about page is another page with a picture of the person and then a paragraph, both are centered in the middle. The background should be a mixed color gradient in css that is user friendly.
6. The contact page is a form that includes the following fields, name, email and text to submit. This form should send an email to the portfolio owner.
